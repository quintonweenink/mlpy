Neural networks trained with PSOs using the global best, local best and Von Neumann information sharing topologies are investigated. Experiments are conducted on five classification and five time series regression problems. It is shown that differences exist in the degree of overfitting between the different topologies. Additionally, non-convergence of the swarms is witnessed, which is hypothetically attributed to the use of a bounded activation function in the neural networks. The hypothesis is supported by experiments conducted using an unbounded activation function in the neural network hidden layer, which lead to convergent swarms. Additionally this also lead to drastically reduced overfitting by the neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimisation has been successfully applied as a neural network training algorithm before, often outperforming traditional gradient-based approaches. However, recent studies have shown that particle swarm optimisation does not scale very well, and performs poorly on high-dimensional neural network architectures. This paper hypothesises that hidden layer saturation is a significant factor contributing to the poor training performance of the particle swarms, hindering good performance on neural networks regardless of the architecture size. A selection of classification problems is used to test this hypothesis. It is discovered that although a certain degree of saturation is necessary for successful training, higher degrees of saturation ultimately lead to poor generalisation. Possible factors leading to saturation are suggested, and means of alleviating saturation in particle swarms through weight initialisation range, maximum velocity, and search space boundaries are analysed. This paper is intended as a preface to a more in-depth study of the problem of saturation in particle swarm optimisation as a neural network training algorithm.},
